  <p>A block of mass $m_1 = 1.6 \, \text{kg}$ rests on an incline with an angle of $\theta = 20^\circ$. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the incline are $\mu_s = 0.8$ and $\mu_k = 0.5$, respectively. The block is connected to a second block of mass $m_2 = 2.0 \, \text{kg}$ suspended vertically, using a massless string over a massless, frictionless pulley.</p>
  <p>(a) Determine the magnitude of the acceleration of block $m_2$ in $\text{m/s}^2$.</p>
