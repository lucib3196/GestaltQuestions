        In the bustling labs of EngiTech University, the Mechanical Engineering team has been working tirelessly on a revolutionary invention: the Caffeinated Engine! Powered by a secret blend of coffee and donuts, this engine operates on a modified Rankine Cycle. The engine's boiler operates at a pressure of ${{params.P1}}$ ${{params.unitsPressure}}$ and a temperature of ${{params.T1}}$ ${{params.unitsTemperature}}$, where it receives its caffeinated steam.
    </p>
    <p> The turbine exhausts to a condenser at ${{params.P2}}$ ${{params.unitsPressure}}$.</p>

<p> Determine the thermal efficiency of this cycle and calculate the net work output per cycle, assuming the mass flow rate of steam is ${{params.Mf}}$ ${{params.unitsMassFlowRate}}$. </p>
